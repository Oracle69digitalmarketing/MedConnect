​## Overview

​**MedConnect** is an open-source healthtech platform designed to improve healthcare access in rural and underserved communities. By combining **AI diagnostics** with intuitive patient management tools, we empower local health providers and connect people to critical health resources. Our mission is to build a reliable, accessible healthcare system for those who need it most.

​## Key Features

​AI Diagnostics: Provide data-driven insights for common health conditions in low-resource settings.

​Patient Management: A secure, intuitive system for health workers to track patient records and appointments.

​Health Resource Mapping: Connect users to nearby clinics, pharmacies, and essential health services.

​Teleconsultation: Facilitate remote consultations with specialists to expand access beyond physical clinics.
